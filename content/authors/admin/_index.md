I am a first-year Ph.D. student at ECE [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/), co-advised by [Prof. Jeffrey Fessler](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/) and [Prof. Douglas Noll](https://nollresearch.engin.umich.edu). I revieved Bachelor degree from Huazhong University of Science & Technology. 

<During my undergraduate, I have an internship at EMC Lab of Missouri University of Science & Technology in the summer of 2016. >

In 2017, I did my undergraduate thesis on Position-based Visual Servoing control under the guidance of [Prof. Ye Yuan](http://yy311.github.io/). In 2018, I worked with [Prof. Jeffrey Fessler](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/) and [Dr. Il Yong Chun](http://ilyong.ch) on acceleating the sparse representation learning using sketching.  I also worked with [Prof. Yuni Dewaraja](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/radiology/yuni-dewaraja-phd) on SPECT/CT scatter estimation using CNNs from Dec. 2018 to Aug. 2019.
